# Plant-Pathology-2021
In the final project of a degree course - Introduction to Computer Vision, I participated in the Kaggle competition - Plant Pathology 2021.
I`ve used different augmentations, re-trained and fine-tuned pre-trained architectures (VGG 19, Resnext50..) for classifying apple diseases.
Through lack of time, I did not use CV methods and looked for ideal hyper parameters this time. In submission, I managed to get a F1 score of 0.79.
